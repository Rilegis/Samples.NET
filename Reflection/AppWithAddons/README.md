# App with addons

### My definition of the term "Addon":
 An addon is a piece of software that EXTENDS the capabilities of a program;
 An addon is NOT a complete program, and as such CANNOT run standalone.


 If you are looking for other ways to add functionalities to your progrma, take a look at my "AppWithPlugins" sample program (WIP).
